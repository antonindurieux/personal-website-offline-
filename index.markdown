# About me

Hi, my name is Antonin, a Data Science enthusiast with a background in geosciences. I have just completed a [Post Master's Degree in Big Data at Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/fr/masteres-specialises/tous-les-ms/big-data){:target="_blank"}. 

My primary education in geosciences and [geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics){:target="_blank"} opened doors for me to work for various clients engaged in global Oil & Gas exploration, Mining, Geothermal and natural risks industries. I was particularly delighted to work on the processing and analysis of a broad range of physical data types: [seismic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_seismic_data_processing){:target="_blank"}, [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_tomography){:target="_blank"}, [gravimetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravimetry){:target="_blank"}, [electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_electromagnetics){:target="_blank"} and [magnetotelluric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotellurics){:target="_blank"}.

I enrolled in a Post Master's Degree in Big Data to have an in-depth knowledge about Data Science and Machine Learning techniques. My aim was to expand my domain of expertise to enable me to process and extract value from a wider range of data. I completed my Post Master's graduate internship at [Tictactrip](https://www.tictactrip.eu/){:target="_blank"}, a booking platform for direct and multimodal trips in Europe. I was tasked to handle all the data-related topics of this start-up operation. My work scope included developing APIs to integrate transport companies' data, analysing data to design a ticket cache system, and building data-visualization dashboards.

You can find my resume [here](assets/files/Antonin_Durieux_resume.pdf), as well as some examples of the work I enjoyed doing [here](/portfolio/). Please feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:antonin.durieux@gmail.com) if you need any additional information.
